Welcome to my website!

My name is Lawrence Ogbeifun, I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Hartwick College. My research interests lie in macroeconomics and span time series analysis, labor, monetary, and environmental economics. I am particularly interested in labor market reform in a dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) framework. I strive to answer questions in my research that are both academically interesting and policy-relevant.
