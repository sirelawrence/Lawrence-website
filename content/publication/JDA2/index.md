abstract: The African continent, renowned for its diverse landscapes and abundant biodiversity, grapples with a critical environmental challenge – deforestation. The swift depletion of forests, serving as the primary habitat for 80% of the world’s terrestrial animals and plants, poses a severe threat in Africa. Human activities, including logging, agricultural expansion, and urbanization, have jeopardized numerous ecosystems, exacerbating the overarching global climate crisis. Beyond serving as mere collections of trees, forests are intricate ecosystems supporting a staggering diversity of flora and fauna. The repercussions of forest loss in Africa are profound, resulting in a significant decline in biodiversity. Numerous species, some exclusive to these ecosystems and found nowhere else on the planet, now teeter on the brink of extinction. The predicament of deforestation in Africa is intimately intertwined with the broader global challenge of climate change. Urgency is paramount in addressing this crisis, as the loss of forests impacts not only local ecosystems but also exacerbates the overarching climate emergency. Reforestation emerges as a pivotal solution, offering an opportunity to reverse the damage inflicted on these vital ecosystems. This study examines whether forest natural resources can explain the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in African countries. The empirical strategy is based on the second-generation cointegration approach, cross-sectional dependency autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) and Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator. The findings show a potential long-run relationship between the forest rent and the environment. Further analysis highlights the importance of effective management of natural forest resources for improving environmental quality in Africa. We recommend that policymakers prioritize the restoration of ecosystems that have suffered carbon depletion due to human activities. Restoration efforts should strategically aim to enhance carbon sequestration capacity and rebuild biodiversity. Additionally, the establishment of robust monitoring and reporting systems is imperative to track current carbon emissions from forests. This entails regular assessments of forest carbon stocks, land-use changes, and the effectiveness of ongoing conservation and restoration initiatives.
