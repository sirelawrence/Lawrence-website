abstract: This paper examines the role of the circular economy and inclusive green growth in promoting energy transition and carbon neutrality for several European countries during 2009–2021, using an advanced econometric strategy. To achieve this objective, we employed a three-pronged empirical strategy. The first strategy involved standard panel specifications, such as pooled ordinary least squares, Fixed Effects, Roger panel regression, white panel regression, and Driscoll–Kraay standard errors. The second strategy explored the long- and short-term dynamics of the relationships using the dynamic specifications of the Generalised Method of Moments, comprising the augmented Arellano–Bond, Ahn–Schmidt, Arellano–Bond, and Arellano–Bover/Blundell–Bond estimators. It further controls for endoegeneity using the Two stages Lease Square (2SLS and Lewbel 2SLS). The third strategy employed the Machado and Silva quantiles via moments to re-evaluate the heterogeneity drivers of carbon neutrality. Furthermore, an alternative and complementary strategy based on the statistical procedures of Hausman–Taylor and Feasible Generalized Least Squares was employed to verify robustness. The findings suggest that prior carbon emissions positively predict future emissions. Also, our results reveal that the adoption of a circular economy, including green growth and renewable energy, can significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions. In contrast, domestic economic drivers, and eco-innovation increase carbon emissions. We propose that policymakers mandate producers to oversee the entirety of their product life cycles as a means to mitigate carbon emissions. Furthermore, endorsing training programs and educational initiatives aimed at cultivating the requisite skills for the energy transition and the adoption of circular economy practices is imperative for ensuring the realization of a successful low-carbon economy.
