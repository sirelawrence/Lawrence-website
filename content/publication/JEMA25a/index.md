abstract: The relentless surge in carbon emissions is exacting a devastating toll on human wellbeing, critical infrastructure, and natural ecosystems, leaving a stark and distressing legacy of destruction. Communities worldwide are reeling from the impacts of pervasive smog, record-breaking wildfires, and deadly heatwaves—manifestations of a climate crisis that grows more severe by the day. Once a vanguard of environmental policy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) now struggles with exceeding emissions targets, eroding its credibility and influence. Fragmented implementation of key frameworks—such as Inclusive Green Growth, the Circular Economy, and Energy Transition—has undermined their impact. The urgency of the moment was underscored by the report of COP29, which issued an unequivocal call to action for OECD nations to step up and lead with ambitious, unified strategies. Embracing inclusive green growth (IGG)—a paradigm that harmonizes economic development with environmental sustainability and social equity—offers a clear path forward. By integrating these elements into a cohesive response, the OECD can reignite its leadership role and drive meaningful progress toward a sustainable future. This paper advocates for a unified strategy integrating IGG, CE, and ET to achieve carbon neutrality. It introduces a streamlined environmental model designed to assess the effectiveness of this integrated approach rigorously. Drawing on data from 24 countries between 2000 and 2020, and employing advanced time series and dynamic analysis, this study offers theoretical and empirical insights into the interactions among the key variables. The results show that integrated policies significantly enhance the effectiveness of green growth and energy transitions, ensuring equitable benefits across all societal segments, including marginalized communities. By addressing the complex, interrelated nature of sustainability challenges, these policies offer a robust framework consolidating diverse perspectives and expertise, driving transformative and profound change.
