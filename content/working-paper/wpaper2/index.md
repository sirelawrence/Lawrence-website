abstract: How well does labor market reform perform under different market conditions? This paper shows that a reform aimed at improving labor market flexibility has (un)intended consequences on macroeconomic variables. I developed a New Keynesian model with an environment characterized by frictions in the labor market. I investigate the effects of labor market reforms, described by a permanent change in the labor market freedom index (LMFI), a proxy for reform. The main findings are threefold. First, the long-run implication of improving labor market flexibility depends on the policy’s channel. Second, wage rigidity only matters in the short-run as it either lengthens or quickens the transition path. Third, firms tend to respond differently in the short-run when reform is pre-announced.
