abstract: How does labor market reform contribute to business cycle dynamics? I develop a real business cycle model in which labor market reform 
affects economic activity by improving employment matching efficiency and reducing vacancy posting costs. I then use shocks to a labor market 
freedom index (LMFI) to proxy for labor market reform in the United States and calibrate the model under different shock transmission channels 
to test the empirical relevance of these mechanisms. The impulse response shows that the positive net effect of the LMFI shock on vacancy rate 
from the structural model with both channels closely fits U.S. data in the VAR model. On the other hand, using OECD data, vacancy rate impulse 
response shows that both the panel VAR analysis and the disaggregated country-level analysis support the channels of shock transmission identified 
in the structural model.
